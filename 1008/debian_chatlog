[15:28] Wombert: there is no web interface for reporting bugs?
[15:28] eptalon: Wombert: bugs.debian.org?
[15:29] Wombert: well, I can send an email there
[15:29] Wombert: in a nerd-ish format...
[15:29] jelly-home: Wombert: that's how it goes.  You can use a tool like reportbug to help in generating the mail
[15:29] Wombert: jelly-home: I'm not a debian user
[15:29] Wombert: it's just that... well
[15:29] Wombert: once again, the php5 package is completely ruined
[15:30] eptalon: Wombert: http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting
[15:30] Wombert: and I'm kind of sick of implementing workarounds in my software
[15:30] Wombert: and... yeah
[15:30] Wombert: yeah I'll do that, eptalon
[15:30] themill: Wombert: what's wrong with it?
[15:30] eptalon: Wombert: or use reportbug.
[15:30] Wombert: themill: well, in olden times, it was incorrectly backported security fixes that ruined streams, for instance
[15:30] jelly-home: Wombert: eh, sounds like you are a debian user or you know one :-)
[15:30] Wombert: this time, it's http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-php-maint/2008-November/004670.html
[15:31] jelly-home: Wombert: what did it completely break?
[15:31] Wombert: with that change (why isn't that being contributed to PHP instead, anyway?), there is no way to know the actual timezone
[15:31] themill: Wombert: php's TZ handling is braindead. You can't blame debian for that
[15:31] Wombert: it keeps returning System/Localtime
[15:31] Wombert: instead of the resolved timezone
[15:32] Wombert: and I need to know the *actual* name so I can use the timezone, make calculations with it etc in third party code (that doesn't use internal timezone functions)
[15:32] Wombert: (because, as themill pointed out, PHP's stuff is hopeless)
[15:32] jelly-home: Wombert: the mail says "Discussed upstream but was not desired."
[15:33] themill: Wombert: you have to actually set the TZ somewhere and istr this has been the case since php 5.1
[15:33] Wombert: I can craete a timezone with System/Localtime, and get the offset, but that doesn't help me once I start making calculations where I need DST info etc
[15:33] jelly-home: Wombert: also, the mail suggests setting data.timezone or TZ env.var
[15:34] Wombert: I know
[15:34] Wombert: but we're maintaining a framework
[15:34] Wombert: with users that are sometimes... clueless
[15:34] jelly-home: how does it not apply to your situation?
[15:34] Wombert: look
[15:34] Wombert: we're using date_default_timezone_get() to get the system tz
[15:35] Wombert: which is fine on all systems, and returns Europe/London or something as a last resort, except... for that guy, on debian (?), where it returns System/Localtime
[15:35] Wombert: System/Localtime is not in the tzinfo database
[15:35] Wombert: so we cannot get info on it, or make an instance of our own timezone object using that timezone
[15:36] Wombert: I can ask PHP for the abbreviated timezone name (NOVT), but that's not authoritative
[15:36] Wombert: I need the actual name, Asia/Novosibirsk
[15:37] jelly-home: Wombert: I guess you could parse /etc/localtime when you get the System/Localtime hack
[15:37] Wombert: jelly-home: I don't *want* to
[15:37] themill: Wombert: date_default_timezone_get() can't be trusted anyway. If you get System/Localtime just assume it's UTC or something and tell the user to actually configure things properly.
[15:38] Wombert: themill: uh huh
[15:38] themill: Wombert: actually, I always require PHP TZ things to be configured by the user. It defaults to Europe/London unless the user sets it to something different. There's no point in trying to guess through php.
[15:40] themill: Wombert: the server time is meaningless anyway. You want the time where the user is or the time at the location the user is interested in. They can be 3 different things.
[15:40] Wombert: http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/p/php5/php5_5.2.6.dfsg.1-0.1~lenny1/changelog
[15:40] Wombert: there it is, themill / jelly-home
[15:41] themill: Wombert: err... yes, that's a debian changelog. What about it?
[15:41] Wombert: it says the patch was included in that package
[15:42] Wombert: why is stuff like that done
[15:42] Wombert: I mean, why isn't such a change contributed to PHP
[15:42] Wombert: it breaks applications
[15:43] jelly-home: Wombert: the redhat author wrote that upstream didn't like it
[15:43] valdyn: Wombert: that patch is in readhat too?
[15:43] Wombert: I have no idea
[15:43] jelly-home: Wombert: you pasted that mail yourself
[15:44] jelly-home: Wombert: I guess if your app is large enough, you should probably take it to the php-maint list and discuss possible solutions
[15:44] Wombert: jelly-home: let me check that
[15:44] jelly-home: Wombert: "Discussed upstream but was not desired."
[15:44] Wombert: jelly-home: wait, the size of my application is a factor for considering bugfixes?
[15:45] Wombert: great!
[15:45] Assid: jelly belly!
[15:45] valdyn: Wombert: popularity, not codesize
[15:45] jelly-home: Wombert: the number of affected users matters yes
[15:45] Wombert: really?
[15:45] Wombert: awesome
[15:45] jelly-home: Wombert: that patch fixes problems for some users
[15:45] Wombert: so PHP is ruined to the point where it's not operaating consistently across platforms anymore
[15:45] Wombert: and
[15:45] stoned: good morning
[15:45] Wombert: holy cow
[15:45] Wombert: you have to be joking
[15:46] valdyn: Wombert: I'm not sure its supposed to
[15:46] stoned: ##php
[15:46] jelly-home: Wombert: changelog points to http://bugs.debian.org/447174 http://bugs.debian.org/471104; I have not investiagted in detail
[15:52] bzed: Wombert: php is insanely broken by design, including the time zone related functions. blame upstream for the inconsistent behaviour and find a way to work around it.
[15:53] jelly-home: bzed: there's a design behind php?
[15:54] bzed: people argue ther eis...
[15:54] Wombert: look
[15:54] Wombert: the point is
[15:54] Wombert: I then format dates
[15:54] Wombert: or output the timezone name
[15:54] Wombert: whichever
[15:54] Wombert: and it returns System/Localtime
[15:54] Wombert: and that works on debian, but nowhere else
[15:54] Wombert: ever heard about "interoperability"?
[15:54] Wombert: -about +of
[15:54] Wombert: it's broken, period
[15:54] Wombert: and it's a bad idea to begin with
[15:55] bzed: Wombert: read http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=471104 - php ships their own, broken and outdated timezone information
[15:55] bzed: that's broken
[15:55] Wombert: that's wrong, bzed
[15:55] Wombert: you can easily update PHP's timezone info through pecl
[15:55] Wombert: that's the mechanism for it
[15:56] jelly-home: Wombert: it requires user intervention, though
[15:57] bzed: Wombert: sorry, but using included time zone data on systems where the system is able to provide it, is insanely broken.
[15:58] Wombert: bzed: look
[15:58] Wombert: that patch
[15:58] Wombert: breaks apps
[15:58] jelly-home: Wombert: we know.  It also unbreaks tz data.
[15:58] Wombert: it should *maybe* return something useful when asked for the actual timezone name (it does for the abbreviation)
[15:59] Wombert: jelly-home: the thing is
[15:59] bzed: Wombert: depending onthe actual timezone is broken, too.
[15:59] Wombert: I can do date_default_timezone_set() to "fix" it for me
[15:59] Wombert: or something
[15:59] Wombert: but
[15:59] Wombert: gah
[16:00] Wombert: bzed: pardon?
[16:00] jelly-home: Wombert: you really want to take this to pkg-php-maint@lists.alioth.debian.org; this channel is pretty much end-user support
[16:00] bzed: Wombert: use a unix time stamp and apply a time zone on it, if you really need to.
[16:01] jelly-home: Wombert: it's likely redhat's or fedora's php will be broken in a similar way
[16:02] Wombert: great
[16:02] Wombert: maybe that guy should have listened to the php devs that declined it
[16:02] â€¢ jelly-home doesn't use debian's php for other reasons
[16:02] bzed: Wombert: again, blame php upstream for it.
[16:02] Wombert: bzed: I'd like to blame debian
[16:02] Wombert: because it's broken there
[16:02] bzed: write a bug report.
[16:02] Wombert: yeah
[16:03] Wombert: yeah
[16:04] Wombert: awesome
[16:04] Wombert: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=469532
[16:06] bzed: Wombert: read through the bug, understand it, and blame php. neither a fault of redhat nor of debian.
[16:06] Wombert: bzed: maybe the patch is a good idea; the implementaiton however is useless
[16:06] bzed: Wombert: the way these things are handled in php are insanely broken, the patch makes things better, nothign else.
[16:07] bzed: Wombert: but again, this is thr wrong place to discuss it, either send a bug report, or diskuss it on the maintainer mailing list
